**Eat-Blitz** is a full-featured food ordering application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The project is structured into three main folders: `frontend`, `backend`, and `admin`, representing the client-side, server-side, and admin panel functionalities. This setup allows users to `browse menus`, `place orders`, and `manage orders` efficiently. The application likely includes features for user `authentication`, `order tracking`, and `integration with a database` for managing restaurant data and user interactions.
